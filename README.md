# Student-Record

- Using Collection package of Java, developed a code which asks for the student information including marks of 6 subjects 
and states if the student has passed or failed.
- It also specifies the student's percentage.
- The code can take multiple student data depending upon the end user's requirement.
- If multiple student data has been requested then while displaying all the student data,
it will be sorted based on First and last name of the student.
